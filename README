Almost all projects eventually come into a phase where more functionality or features is/are required. Depending on the nature of the requirement one may decide how to implement it. This can be an addition to the existing code-base, where more core-functionality can be added, but this can also be a separate module that needs to communicate with, or is depending on, the core code-base. Again, depending on the nature of the requirement there are a lot of choices to be made.

In this paper we focus on using the concepts of Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP) to help making decisions about the implementation of certain requirements. As a case-study we use the requirement of an API on top of an existing code-base.

An API is a typical separate module next to a core code-base since it does not add extra functionality to the existing system, it rather adds the ability to make the exact same system more operable, more programmable and more flexible.
